## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
* Node.js (LTS version)
* npm
* Git

### Local Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SantanuDas7095/Ecommerce](https://github.com/SantanuDas7095/Ecommerce)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies for the frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm install react-router-dom react-toastify
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies for the backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm init
    npm i cors dotenv express jsonwebtoken mongoose multer nodemon stripe validator cloudinary bcrypt
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies for the admin:**
    ```bash
    cd admin
    npm install
    npm install axios react-router-dom react-toastify
    ```
5.  **Configure environment variables for frontend:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory.
    * Add your MongoDB connection string and a secret key:
        ```env
        VITE_BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:4000'
        ```    
6.  **Configure environment variables for backend:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    * Add your MongoDB connection string and a secret key:
        ```env
        MONGODB_URI = "your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string"
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = "your_cloudinary_api_key"
        CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key"
        CLOUDINARY_NAME = "your_cloudinary_name"
        JWT_SECRET = "your_jwt_secret_key"
        ADMIN_EMAIL = "admin_email"
        ```
7.  **Configure environment variables for admin:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the `admin` directory.
    * Add your MongoDB connection string and a secret key:
        ```env
        VITE_BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:4000'
        ```            
8.  **Run the application:**
    * In the `backend` directory, run:
        ```bash
        npm start server
        ```
    The application-backend will be live at `http://localhost:4000`.

    * In a new terminal, in the `frontend` directory, run:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    The application will be live at `http://localhost:5173`.

    * In a new terminal, in the `frontend` directory, run:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    The application-admin will be live at `http://localhost:5174`.

## Deployment on Vercel üåê

Vercel offers an easy way to deploy MERN applications by recognizing both the frontend and backend.

1.  Connect your GitHub repository to your Vercel account.
2.  Vercel will automatically detect the React app in the `frontend` directory and the Node.js API in the `backend` directory.
3.  Ensure you have added your environment variables (like `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`) to your Vercel project settings.
